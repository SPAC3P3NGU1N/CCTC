Pre-Boot, Boot, Logon Pre-WINDOWS 7
--------------------
BIOS:
Pre-Boot - POST - Power On Self Test - runs from firmware on the BIOS chip
- A single beep is a GOOD POST test

MBR - Master Boot Record 
-loads boot code
-if running a UEFI in legacy mode, you'll still have a MBR; if not in legacy mode, no MBR;

Bootcode 
-searches partition table for boot sector and loads NTLDR

NTLDR - 
-reads in boot.ini for OS choices, runs NTDETECT.com to query hardware
-stored data from NTDETECT.com in HKLM\Hardware registry key
-starts NTOSKRNL.exe and HAL.dll - HAL basically serves as a link between the user and the hardware
-DynamicLinkLibraries (.dll) are basically executables that must be called by another executable)

NTOSKRNL.exe
-starts SMSS.exe - Session Manager SubSystem (manages a windows session)

SMSS.exe
-launches Winlogon.exe and CSRSS "scissors cut threads"
-CSRSS manages threads

Winlogon.exe - usually waits for the SAS for windows - CTRL-ALT-DEL
-starts LSASS, loads MSGINA, starts SCM, starts logonui.exe
Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS)

MSGINA - Microsoft Graphical identification and authorization dll library
	-activates the user shell
	-customizable identification and authentication procedures
	-logon dialog

Winlogon - receives credentials from MSGINA and passes them to LSASS

LSASS - checks credentials against LSA database cache then NTLM or Kerberos if necessary
	-sends uer token back to Winlogon

Winlogon - starts userinit in user context

Userinit -loads user profile, runs startup programs, starts explorer.exe

---------------------------------------------------------------------
A process is a container that runs one or more threads
Services are the non-interactive threads that run

Pre-boot/etc for Windows 7 - two different types of pre-boot processes: UEFI and BIOS
-------------------------
***BIOS***
-POST
-MBR
	-first 512byte sector on HDD
	-reads and loads Volume Boot Record
-VBR
	-loads bootmgr into memory
-Bootmgr
	-essentially replaced boot.ini
	-reads boot config database (BCD)
	-boot menu and memtest
	-calls winload (fresh boot)
	-calls winresume
-Winload
	-essentially replaced NTLDR
	-loads NTOSKRNL.exe
	-loads dependencies
	-loads device drivers

OR

***EFI/UEFI***
-POST
-Runs Bootloader from NVRAM
	-loads Boot Config Database (BCD) also in NVRAM
-Bootloader detects hardware
-EFI boot manager gives OS boot menu
-Winload.efi: EFI version of Winload
-Requires EFI system partition
	-formatted as FAT
	-up to 1gb in size

-------------------------------
Main difference between Local Logon and Domain Logon:
Local logon authenticates locally with the Security Account Manager (SAM)
Domain logon authenticates with the domain controller
--------------------------------------------------------

Windows Process States
----------------------
New/Created:

Running: Process that is actually executing

Ready: Process is waiting allocation to the processor, but everything else is good to go
Three kinds of scheduling within ready state: Long/Medium/Short

Waiting: Process is waiting for some condition to be met to move into ready state
A thread can enter wait state in a number of different ways:
1- thread can wait for an object to synchronize its execution
2- the OS can wait on the threads behalf
3- environment subsystem can direct the thread to suspend itself
A thread can also be gate waiting, or waiting on a gate dispatcher object

Terminate/Exit: process is complete, and is waiting to be removed from main memory
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Virtual Memory
--------------
Efficient allocation of memory
Allows for the over-allocation of memory
