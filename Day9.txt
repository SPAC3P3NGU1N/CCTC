Windows Security
----------------
Host-based:
- Runs local on machine
	- System Firewalls
	- Process monitoring, kernel calls
	- Directory monitoring
	- System setting/Registry monitoring
	- Directory monitoring
	- System setting/Registry Monitoring
	- Log monitoring
	- Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)
	- Application Whitelisting

- Network-based:
	- Monitors traffic across the wire, can be inline or passive
		- inline usually modifies traffic between destination and source
	- Network Firewalls
	- IDS/IPS
	- Web/Application Proxy
	- VPN Concentrator

- Signature-based Security
	- Device or Software that maintains a database of attack signatures
	- Only detects previously identified and cataloged attacks
	- Signatures require constant updating
	- Small changes to a binary could bypass the signature
	- Zero-days, since they have not been seen before, usually bypass signature-based security

- Heuristic-Based
	- Device or Software develops a baseline of the system, then looks for anomalous activity
	- Has potential to catch a Zero-day... maybe
	- Larger of number of false positives vs detection based

Windows Auditing
----------------
Why are audit policies important?
	- Maintains a record of access to secure objects

Function of main logs:
	- At startup, LSASS sends the system audit policy to the Security Reference Monitor (SRM)
	- When an object is accessed, SRM generates auditing messages and sends them to LSASS
	- LSASS sends the event log messages on to the Event Logger

Main Logs:
	- Application = events logged by apps
	- Security = logins/logoffs, and events related to resource use
	- System = events logged by system components
	- CustomLog = events logged by apps that create a custom log

Audit Policy Settings
	- Auditing settings are contained in the System Access Control List (SACL)
		- Object-access control entry (ACE) = audit settings defined per object basis
	- Global Audit Policy - SACL
		- Global policy to setup auditing on all objects of a particular type
			-e.g. Registry keys or file system objects
	- Local security policy
		-must also be enabled for auditing to be logged

To configure audit policies
- Local Security Policy (GUI-based_
	- Advanced audit policy configuration settings
- via Command Line
	- auditpol /get /category:*
		-From here
		-auditpol /set /subcategory:"<CATEGORY>" /success:enable <OR> disable /failure:enable 
			<OR> disable
	- auditpol /resourceSACL /type:file /view
	- auditpol /resourceSACL /type:Key /view

View/Analyze Event Logs 
-GUI
	- eventvwr
		- reads from c:\windws\system32\winevt
		- locations are configurable
-CLI
	-wevtutil el = shows all logs
	-wevtutil gli security = get security log info
	-wevtutil qe security /c:3 = get last 3 events from security log

-Powershell
	-get-eventlog -logname System -newest 10 = shows the latest 10 entries into the System logg
