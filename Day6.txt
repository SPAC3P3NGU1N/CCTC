Malware/Process Analysis
------------------------
Static Analysis: Examine malware without executing it
	- Strings command in CMD - see if any strings jump out as maliscious
		- Syntax: strings <filepath of executable> 
		- Can also use strings <filepath of exe> | findstr /i "<search string>"	
	
	- IDA Pro, OLEDebug - used to perform binary analysis on a file

	- Look at the DLL's used/referenced in STRINGS output

	- OSINT - Google is your friend
		- Name/hash check for existing information online
		- Check out VirusTotal.com

Dynamic Analysis: Examine malware while it is running
	- ProcMon / TaskManager / Procexp
	- TCPView
	- IDA Pro, OLEDebug
	- Reg Shot
	- Wireshark


Virtualization
--------------
Allows you to create multiple simulated environments from a physical hardware system.
Software called a Hypervisor serves as the connection between the virtual machines and the hardware/resources.


Situational Awareness
---------------------
Things to figure out:
- What is running on the system?
	- Processes - tasklist, pslist, procexp, procmon, get-process, wmic process
	- Services - get-service | where-object {$_.status -eq 'running'}, psservice, wmic service 
	- Scheduled Tasks - get-scheduledtask | where state -eq 'ready', schtasks
	- Registry Keys - look for RunOnce, RunKey references, 
	- Security Products - get-childitem HKLM:\SOFTWARE
	- Disk Drives - wmic diskdrive list /format:list

- Networking
	- System networking settings - ipconfig /all, 
	- Local Subnet - get your Gateway, DHCP server, DNS
	- Activte Network Connections - netstat -ano |findstr /i 'established'
	- Routing - route print, netstat -r, 
	- Firewall Settings - get-NetFirewallRule | where{$_.Enabled -eq 'True' -and $_.Direction -eq 
			      'Inbound'}, gmore c:\windws\system32\logfiles\firewall\pfirewall.log

- Users
	- Accounts - net user, net user <username>, get-aduser -filter 'Enabled -eq "False"' (this shows 
		     disabled users), wmic useraccount, psloggedon
	- Groups - net localgroup, wmic group
	- Domain - get-addomain, get-ADGroupMember "domain admins", 

Logging and Auditing
	- Windows event logs - psloglist, psloglist -a <date> (this shows all rules timestamped after a 
				specified date)
	- Windows auditing policies - auditpol /get /category:* 

Areas that are MOST important:
-Running Processes
-Active Users
-Network Configuration
-Network Communications
-Logging
-Scheduled Jobs
-Aliases
-Handle - the middleman that allows a process to access hardware
