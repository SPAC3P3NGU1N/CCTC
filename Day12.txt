Incident Response
-----------------

6 Phases of Incident Response ("be PICIER about your response")
- Preparation
	- Packing List
	- Update tools
	- Training
	- Documentation
	- Network Diagrams
	- Incident Response Team
	- Enable NTP
- Identification
	- Was it an INCIDENT or ADVERSE EVENT?
	- Adverse Event
		- Event with negative consequences
		- Unauthorized use of system privileges
		- Unauthorized acess to sensitve data
		- Execution of malware that destroys data
	- Incidents
		- Event that violates an organization's security or privacy policies
		- Unusual Activity/Configs outside baseline
		- Unknown connection
		- Unusual user privileges/unknown user accounts
		- External devices
		- High Traffic Volumes
		- Unusual Logons
- Containment
	- Limit damage caused to systems and prevent future damage
		- Cordon and Clear (VLANs)
		- Remove from Network
		- Quarantine
		- Sandbox
		- Patch / Hotfix
		- Add Firewalls
- Investigation
	- Determine the priority/scope/root cause of an incident
		- Attribution
		- Avenue of approach
		- Indicators of Compromise
		- Vulnerability Assessment
		- Forensic Analysis
- Eradication
	- Remove the infection
		- From the investigation, you should know what you have to remove
		- Reimage
		- Key rotation
		- Clean (and monitor)
- Recovery
	- Determine when to bring the system back into production and how long we montiro the system for signs of abnormal activity
		- Remove VLANs
		- Return network to normal
		- Lessons Learned
		- Update SOP, AAR
		- Continually Monitor (leave sensors behind)

Volatility
-----------
- Order of Volatility
	- Registers, cache
	- Routing Table, arp cache, process table, kernel statistics, memory (RAM)
	- temporary file systems
	- disk and other storage media
	- remote logging and monitoring data that is relevant to the system in question
	- physical configuration, network topology
	- archival media
