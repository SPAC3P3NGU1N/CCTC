Windows Security System Concepts (Active Directory)
-------------------------------
- Security Reference Monitor (SRM): In Kernel Mode (ntoskrnl)
- Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) - passes credentials to the SAM
- LSASS Policy database
- Security Accounts Manager (SAM)
- SAM Database: HKLM\SAM
- Active Dir
- Authentication Packages
- Interactive Logon Manager (Winlogon)
- Logon User Interface (LogonUI)
- Credential Providers (CP)
- Network Logon Service (Netlogon)
- Kernel Security Device Driver (KSecDD)

Security Identifier (SID) and 

SID's have the numbers that look like S-1-5-21-238947234-32948723947-32498723490-1003
The domain section is the 21 section thru the last long section
The RID is the last 4 digits and tells what kind of account it is:
	- 500 - Admin account
	- 501 - Guest Account
	- 1000+ - Beginning of User Accounts
-To see the SID/RID
	- reg query HKU
		- reg query "hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\profileslist\{SID}"	
	- psgetsid
	- WMIC useraccount list brief
		- WMIC useraccount get name, sid, fullname
	- get-childitem registry::HKEY_USERS -error action silentlycontinue
		- get-childitem 'hklm:\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\profilelist\'

Logical and Physical Structure of Active Directory
- Logical Structure
	- Domains - top level structure
	- Organizational Unit - allows subdivision of domains, e.g. army unit subdomains (USASOC)
	- Trees and Forest - A tree is a grouping of multiple domains, usually parent/child relationship, 			the Forest is the very top of the AD Structure. It holds all objects, OUs, and domains

- Physical Structure
	- Sites - an AD object representing a collection of IP subnets
	- Domain Controllers
	- Member Servers

- gpresult
	- a CLI command that displays the group policies that are issued to this workstation
