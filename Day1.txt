Log into Openstack, hit Orchestration, Stacks, create new stack, direct input, copy/paste the yaml file from Blackboard and take out trailing spaces, create new.

After 25mins, go to Compute, Instances, Windows 1803, Console
Log in with last name and password.
Let the scripts run.

To run as RDP, in the Linux CLI:
xfreerdp +clipboard /size 1920x1020 /u:Philips /p:password /v:10.50.24.25 (get the IP from OpenStack)

Once in the box, open a Command shell

Windows Command Line Commands:
color A - changes everything to green
set - shows all environmental variables
set X=4 - sets the variable X to equal 4
echo %X% - displays the vaule of X
where - finds executables within the PATH variable
dir - list folder contents
type - output contents of a file
findstr - windows grep (use /i switch before the string to use case-insensitive)
hostname - displays system hostname
date /t - output system date (the /t keeps it from trying to set)
time /t - output system time (the /t "" "")

Redirection Operators:
> - redirects STDOUT. create/overwrite
>> - redirects STDOUT. create/appends
| - piping sends output of one command to input of another

Conditional Processing:
& - execute second command regardless of success/failure of first
; - execute second command regardless of success/failure of first
&& - execute second command ONLY if the first is successful
|| - execute second command ONLY if the first fails

Nesting Commands:
( ) - nest commands for complex arrangements
- Use these to create IF/ELSE commands, for example
((dir COMMAND && echo success) || echo failure) - this will try to run the COMMAND, and output success if it works, but if it fails it will echo failure
