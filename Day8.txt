Windows Firewall
----------------
Three Profiles:
- Public - the most restrictive
- Private - 
- Domain - the least restrictive

To show the firewall rules:
-get-netfirewallrule | select Name, Enabled, Direction, Description | Format-List - powershell command to display firewall rules
-wf - brings up the GUI
-netsh advfirewall show allprofiles
-wmic /namespace:\\Root\StandardCimv2 path MSFT_NetFirewallRule where 'DisplayName LIKE %ICMP% get Displayname,enabled,profiles

To see available set options:
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles

The service that runs the Windows firewall is
MPSSVC

To enable firewall logging:
-netsh advfirewall set allprofiles logging allowedconnections enable
-netsh advfirewall set allprofiles logging droppedconnections enable

File Permissions
----------------
-icacls <filepath of executable> = CLI
-get-acl <filepath> | Format-List = powershell
-accesschk <filepath> = sysinternals tool
-Right Click on file -> Properties -> Security

Windows Resource Protection (WRP) - replaced Windows File Protection
--------------------------
-Keeps certain system files from being overwritten or deleted to save the OS from being corrupted
-Protected resources can only be modified by the Windows Module Installer (trustedinstaller.exe) service
-Can also protect system registry keys
-Backup of the files are kept in %Windir%\winsxs\Backup or C:\Windows\winsxs\Backup

System File Checker
-------------------
sfc /verifyfile=<filepath> = this checks to see if the file has bene modified or has integrity violations
sfc /scannow - verifies whole system


User Account Control
--------------------
-UAC controls the privileges of user-run applications to prevent the modification of system files, -resources or settings to prevent damage.
-It is possible for an automatic elevation of UAC permissions that allow programs to bypass the popup UAC confirmation
-To check on UAC settings for a file:
	- sigcheck -m <filepath> = sysinternals tool that shows the permissions

-To alter the permissions of a file
	- Go into Regedit.exe
	- HKCU\Software\Classes

-UIPI = user interface privilege isolation
	- This issues a privilege level (integrity level) to each process
	- Higher privileged processes can send messages to lower level
	- but lower can only read from higher, not send messages to higher

Information Assurance (IA)
--------------------------
The practice of assuring information and managing risks related to the use/processing/storage/transmission of data and the systems/processes used to do so

Includes protection of the CIA triad, plus authenticity and non-repudiation
