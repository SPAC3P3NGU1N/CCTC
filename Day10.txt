Windows Networking
------------------
Key Points Today
SMB
Mail Slots
NetBios
RPC
Sockets

Remote Procedure Call
- Applications load a DLL containing stub procedures for remote functions
-


Mailslots
- One way interprocess communication
- acts as a file kept in memory
- useful for a single process sending broadcasts to multiple processes

SMB/CIFS and NetBIOS
- Server Message Block
	- Primary remote file-access protocol on Windows
	- Also known as Common Internet Files System (CIFS)
-NetBIOS
	-nbtstat command


Windows Network Naming Schemes
- Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
	- Hostname or computer name
- DNS domain hierarchy location
- The combination of these form the FQDN for the system

Sockets
- A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on a network, where an endpoint consists of an IP address and port number
	- Three types of sockets
		- Stream
			- Enable processes to communicate via TCP
			- Stream socket allows bidirectional, reliable, sequenced flow of data
			- After connection establishes, data can be read from and written as byte stream
		- Datagram
			- Enable processes to communicate via UDP
			- Allows bidirectional flow of data, but not sequenced or reliable
			- Messages via Datagram can be duplicated and/or dropped
		- Raw
			- Enable access to the underlying transport provider
			- Can manipulate the underlying transport, so they can be used for malicious purposes that pose a security threat.

Network Analysis Built-in Tools
-------------------------------
- ipconfig
	- ipconfig /all = shows all network settings
	- ipconfig /displaydns = shows DNS resolver cache

- nbtstat
	- nbtstat -A <IP>

- route
	- route print - shows routing table (like netstat -r)

- arp
	- arp -a = shows local domain ARP table

- netstat
	- netstat -ano = shows connections and open ports
	- netstat -anb = shows PIDS tied to activity
	- netstat -s = shows network statistics
	- netstat -r = shows routing table
